        <h1>Selling Your Home</h1>
        <p>This is placeholder copy. Here, we talk about how putting a price on one of your more valuable assets is more than just an exercise in valuation - it's about taking a step forward. The value of a home is more than just a price tag: It contains memories, hard work, thought, and care. So we discuss a number of important factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Why it's important to learn about the market</li>
            <li>Why pre-sale commitment is so important</li>
            <li>How to go about getting maximum return on your investment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Learn more about the process so you know what to expect when it comes to selling one of your most valuable assets.</p>

        <h2>What Is Your Home Worth?</h2>
        <p>
            Many factors go into home valuation than simply the material and labor that went into building it, and the price you paid for it before you moved in. Property values in the surrounding neighborhood, design trends, how well you've cared for it, and many other criteria go in to determining the return you'll get on your investment. Consider:
            <ul>
                <li>What is your floor plan like?</li>
                <li>When was your home built?</li>
                <li>Are its amenities up to date?</li>
                <li>Is there a 'wow' factor that you can point to?</li>
            </ul>
